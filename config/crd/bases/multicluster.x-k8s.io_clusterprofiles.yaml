                            In some environments, the user config may be exactly the same across many clusters
                            (i.e. call this exec plugin) minus some details that are specific to each cluster
                            such as the audience.  This field allows the per cluster config to be directly
                            specified with the cluster info.  Using this field to store secret data is not
                            recommended as one of the prime benefits of exec plugins is that no secrets need
                            to be stored directly in the kubeconfig.

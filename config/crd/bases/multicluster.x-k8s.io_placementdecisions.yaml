          PlacementDecision publishes the set of clusters chosen by a scheduler at a point in time.
          It is a data-only resource that acts as the interface between schedulers and consumers.
          Schedulers write decisions using this format; consumers read from it.

          Following the EndpointSlice convention, a single scheduling decision can fan out to N
          PlacementDecision slices, each limited to 100 clusters. To correlate slices, producers
          MUST set the same multicluster.x-k8s.io/decision-key label on all slices when more than
          one slice exists.

              APIVersion defines the versioned schema of this representation of an object.
              Servers should convert recognized schemas to the latest internal value, and
              may reject unrecognized values.
